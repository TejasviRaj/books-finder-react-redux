        "description": "In 1996, George R.R. Martin electrified fantasy fans around the world when he published A Game of Thrones, the first book in his acclaimed A Song of Ice and Fire series. Since then, Martin has published three more books in the series. The engrossing tale Martin spun with these first novels in his saga has gained more and more fans across the world and has resulted in a number of spin-off products, such including HBO's TV series, card and board games, computer games, sword replicas, comic books and calendars. Perhaps paradoxically, the number of years between each time Martin publishes a new book in the series has increased. Fans have been clamoring for the fifth volume, A Dance with Dragons, since 2005: A book that promises to pick up the storylines of fan-favorite characters left hanging since 1999. As Martin struggles to reach the finish line, or indeed even the halfway point in his epic, his fans wait for the next fix. One way to keep sane during the long waits is to re-read the already published novels. Journey to Westeros with Remy J. Verhoeve as he celebrates his tenth reading of A Game of Thrones. Chapter by chapter, the author, a Dutch-Norwegian English teacher and self-confessed fantasy geek, is both fellow traveler and tour guide as he shares his insightful reflections on Martin's writing techniques, major - and seemingly minor - plot points and characters, and much more. True to its origins as a blogging project undertaken while not-so-patiently waiting for A Dance With Dragons, the author does not hold back in this unauthorized companion book that is both an unabashed homage to the novel that started it all, as well as a candid - and at times controversial - commentary on the issues surrounding the delayed release of the fifth book. Whether or not they agree with everything the author has to say, all fans of A Song of Ice and Fire, from those who have loved the series since its inception in 1996 to those who have only just discovered it through the HBO series, will enjoy this thought-provoking and outspoken book.",

        "description": "Game of Thrones, one of the hottest series on television, leaves hundreds of critics divided on how “feminist” the show really is. Certainly the female characters, strong and weak, embody a variety of archetypes—widow queens, warrior women, damsels in distress, career women, priestesses, crones, mothers and maidens. However, the problem is that most of them play a single role without nuance—even the “strong women” have little to do besides strut about as one-note characters. This book analyzes the women and their portrayals one by one, along with their historical inspirations. Accompanying issues in television studies also appear, from the male gaze to depiction of race. How these characters are treated in the series and how they treat themselves becomes central, as many strip for the pleasure of men or are sacrificed as pawns. Some nude scenes or moments of male violence are fetishized and filmed to tantalize, while others show the women’s trauma and attempt to identify with the scene’s female perspective. The key is whether the characters break out of their traditional roles and become multidimensional.",

        "description": "An in-depth look at the philosophical issues behind HBO's Game of Thrones television series and the books that inspired it George R.R. Martin's New York Times bestselling epic fantasy book series, A Song of Ice and Fire, and the HBO television show adapted from it, have earned critical acclaim and inspired fanatic devotion. This book delves into the many philosophical questions that arise in this complex, character-driven series, including: Is it right for a \"good\" king to usurp the throne of a \"bad\" one and murder his family? How far should you go to protect your family and its secrets? In a fantasy universe with medieval mores and ethics, can female characters reflect modern feminist ideals? Timed for the premiere of the second season of the HBO Game of Thrones series Gives new perspectives on the characters, storylines, and themes of Game of Thrones Draws on great philosophers from ancient Greece to modern America to explore intriguing topics such as the strange creatures of Westeros, the incestuous relationship of Jaime and Cersei Lannister, and what the kings of Westeros can show us about virtue and honor (or the lack thereof) as they play their game of thrones Essential reading for fans, Game of Thrones and Philosophy will enrich your experience of your favorite medieval fantasy series.",
